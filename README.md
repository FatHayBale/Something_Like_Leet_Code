How it works:
The idea of this problem is incredibly simple __main__.py will run 'run def' function located in test.py and put it trough various cases located in 'Cases.json'. Lastly check if returned variables are equal to required solution. 

How to run:
There are 3 general ways to run the program:

1) Inside your prefered code editor run __main__.py located in './Problems Without Given Solution/Problem {number of specific problem you want to get results for}' this will return the results of specific problem you want to check.

2) Run Run_All_Tests.bat located in './Problems Without Given Solution' this will check every single folder with given problem and will return the results.

3) Run test.bat located in './Problems Without Given Solution/Problem {number of specific problem you want to get results for}' this will return the results of specific problem you want to check.
